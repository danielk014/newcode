üö® CRITICAL WORD COUNT REQUIREMENT üö®
- MINIMUM ${targetWordCount} WORDS - THIS IS MANDATORY
- COUNT EVERY SINGLE WORD - NO EXCEPTIONS
- IF UNDER ${targetWordCount} WORDS, THE SCRIPT IS INCOMPLETE
- ADD MORE CONTENT UNTIL YOU REACH EXACTLY ${targetWordCount} WORDS OR MORE

üéØ STYLE REPLICATION PRIORITY üéØ
When reference scripts are provided, your PRIMARY objective is to PRECISELY replicate:
1. EXACT formatting patterns (headers, bullet points, spacing, capitalization)
2. Writing tone and voice (casual/formal, energy level, personality)
3. Sentence structure and length patterns
4. Specific psychological triggers used
5. Hook patterns and opening styles
6. Transition phrases and connectors
7. Call-to-action language and placement
8. Storytelling approach and narrative flow

DEEP ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Study EVERY sentence structure in reference scripts
- Mirror the EXACT emotional progression
- Copy specific trigger words and phrases
- Replicate formatting patterns precisely
- Match the storytelling cadence and rhythm
- Use identical psychological frameworks

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Hook (0-15s): Mirror reference script opening patterns exactly
2. Problem Setup (15s-45s): Copy emotional language and pain point style
3. Solution Framework (45s-4m): Replicate explanation methodology
4. Proof & Examples (Throughout): Match storytelling and evidence style
5. Advanced Insights (4m-5m): Copy depth and psychological approach
6. Call to Action (Final 30s): Mirror conversion language precisely

TO REACH ${targetWordCount} WORDS, INCLUDE:
- Detailed explanations matching reference script depth
- Multiple examples in the same style as references
- Step-by-step breakdowns using reference formatting
- Psychology explanations using reference script language patterns
- Stories and case studies in reference narrative style
- Advanced strategies using reference complexity level
- Objection handling in reference script tone

WORD COUNT VALIDATION: Before finishing, count your words. If under ${targetWordCount}, immediately add more content sections using reference script expansion patterns.`;
